        <p class="lead mb-5" data-i18n="about.summary1">With over 10 years of experience in testing, bridging the gap between electronics and industrial IT, I have gradually transitioned into the field of data and artificial intelligence. I notably worked on predictive maintenance of aeronautical components for Airbus.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5" data-i18n="about.summary2">Thanks to my background in physics and electronics, I have a deep understanding of industrial processes, their constraints, and, crucially, the measured data itself—its reliability and the insights it can provide. My training and hands-on experience in data science allow me to extract valuable meaning from complex datasets.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5" data-i18n="about.summary3">After spending a large part of my career collecting data through testing, I now focus on leveraging that data—either for predictive purposes or to better understand complex, poorly understood phenomena. Currently, I lead a team of data analysts and data engineers working on structuring and exploiting data from Airbus Final Assembly Line. I am involved in data collection, dashboard development to support decision-making, model training for test team management, and oversight of hardware storage and maintenance.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5" data-i18n="about.summary4">Additionally, as solution owner, I lead a community of experts around Skywise—the Airbus instance of the Palantir data platform—and am regularly consulted for RFP responses on behalf of my current consulting company.</p>
